I believe
=========

My core principles
------------------
* Everyone is entitled to:
	* tell their own story
	* dignity
	* recognition
	* hope
* No one is entitled to anything else
* Everyone is responsible for:
	* themselves
	* everyone else
* I strive to:
	* carry my own water
	* tell the truth
	* stand so others may sit
	* leave every situation better than when I arrived (i.e. the “campsite” principle)
* The universe is:
	* fundamentally uncaring
	* incomprehensibly vast
	* random
	* without purpose
* All things and all people have intrinsic meaning and worth beyond their “usefulness” to anyone or anything else
* “Evil” exists but is transient and contingent
* “Good” exists only when we make it

Religion/Sprituality
--------------------
* Anything anyone says about God is wrong, including this.
* Don’t confuse the finger pointing at the moon with the moon.
* Souls arise gradually as a process of interacting with the world, and defining oneself in opposition to it.
* Personality and memory are erased at the moment of death; there will be no “afterlife” in which I perceive myself or my soul.
* But the soul may contain other components, perhaps collectively described as “spirit,” that is/are eternal and transferred between living beings and other energetic systems. 
* Animals might have souls but humans might not be able comprehend them.
* Always the same river, never the same water.
* God “exists” in the same way money “exists.”
* I was never not an atheist like this. I never felt an absence of anything (a “God shaped hole”); it’s just that God is simply unnecessary to my understanding of the world. The (non)presence of God is irrelevant to me.
        * More accurately: of all the qualities of God (omnipotence, omnibenevolence, anthropomorphism, etc.) which we might want to discuss, “existence” is the least salient.

Human Nature
------------
* People are essentially __good__ and fundamentally __lazy.__
	* This explains about 99% of daily behavior.
	* Also assumes basic aspects of survival are assured. *Erst Fressen, dann Moral.*
* Most evil is committed by people thinking they are doing “good.”

Ethics, loosely
------
* The ends do not justify the means; indeed this statement and its more-common obverse are self-contradictory. There is no end, only means. The end you arrive at is entirely a process of your means.

Health
------
* Two hours of vigorous physical motion and fresh air, preferably cold, will fix most minor physical, mental, and spiritual ailments.
* Meat isn’t murder but it isn’t very polite. People who take excessive joy in eating meat are not mentally stable.
* Bicycles are awesome.

Interpersonal relationships
---------------------------
* Shake hands firmly and make eye contact.
* Avoid saying “sorry” and apologies generally. Apologies are about you, not the person wronged.
*  Avoid saying “I promise.” Everything you say is an implicit promise.
* Avoid excuses. These are just another way of saying “I can’t keep my word, but I’m unwilling to own the consequences.”
* I don’t care who made this mess, everyone is obligated to clean it up together.

Politics/Society
----------------
* I am a __conservative__ in the sense that my instinct is to save back for future generations those things that will be difficult or impossible to replace once they are used up.
* I am a __liberal__ in that society will evolve despite our conservative instincts, and we must ultimately embrace that evolution.

Environment
-----------
* Soil, water, clean air and trees. 
* I am not much moved by appeals to Fuzzy Seals and Huggable Owls. These species might be important as bellweathers of more catastrophic change, but my long term interest is in soil, water, clean air and trees.
* Humans, and in particular civilization, is ultimately dependent on a few fragile, complexly-interwoven systems. Our foremost concern should be preserving the smooth running of those systems.
* American have an unhealthy wilderness obsession. In all but a few places, humans have lived within the nonhuman (i.e. “natural”) world for thousands of years. The world will become a greener, better place when we stop trying to keep people “out of” nature, and instead treat the entire world like a garden: a thing to tend and attend to.
* Global warming and nuclear war are the preeminent existential threats to humanity and civilization.
* Future generations will judge the people of 2014 harshly for our attitudes about:
	* Factory farming
	* Resource depletion
	* Global warming
	* Our harm to biodiversity.
	* ... and that much of this was in service of such trivial pleasures
* They will judge us more harshly for these things than we judge past generations for slavery, because they will suffer every day the consequences of our recklessness. 
* And they will judge us for these things for many thousands of years.


Let’s check my privilege
------------------------
Upper-middle class, straight, white, cis, male, skinny, able-bodied other than poor eyesight. Those are the privileges I was born with. A royal flush. 

My privileges manifest almost entirely in me not noticing them. Only once, to my knowledge, has my identity ever been an issue, when I applied for a job at Planned Parenthood. They wanted a woman for the job and they told me so. It was No Big Deal. I guess I should’ve felt some injustice (“what if they told you __to your face__ that you wouldn’t get the job because you were a __woman__!”). I got a job at Kinko’s instead where I was oblivious to the fact that I could work the graveyard shift alone in the most dangerous part of town without fearing anything worse than a holdup. I never took precautions like locking the side door or leaving one phone on speed dial to 911. Like the woman who worked graveyard shift the other nights of the week. It never occurred to me that those were the kinds of things that other people had to do.

The beauty/tragedy of being upper-middle-class/straight/white/cis/male/skinny/able is that I won the lottery without realizing it. AFAIK there isn’t a secret cabal of u/s/w/c/m/s/a lottery winners twirling their mustaches and plotting to grind down Everyone Else. We just fail upward and then get mad at everyone else for not failing upward. (“How hard could it be? This is a __meritocracy__” etc.) 

I doubt my father, in the I dunno 1980s, often thought of himself as belonging to any culture other than Default. Increasingly white/straight/etc. men don’t get to take their identity for granted and this is why we throw tantrums. Identity politics is work we never had to do before. But maybe we’ll gain a little space to reflect on our identities. As in: *I really like __white__ music.* I can listen to a Sonic Youth album and think, “wow, I can hear how very very __white__ these people are,” and not in a “white people be all like *this*” way or a white-supremacist way but in a genuine “this is the music of My People” way. 

The privilege I think most about is the upper-middle-class one. Maybe that’s my weakest privilege, I’m only a few paychecks away from being not-upper-middle-class. My usual line in discussions of identity politics is that class matters more than other identities. It is certainly the identity I notice first when I’m dealing with someone, usually because of their speech and dress. But maybe that’s my other privileges talking. 

The privileges I think least about are sexual orientation and able-bodiedness. In fact I had to go back and add those in to this text. I am not self-aware enough to reckon this weird omission. 

I don’t apologize for my privileges. I try not to apologize generally (see *Interpersonal Relationships,* above.) White liberal guilt is for the benefit of white liberals. My goal instead is __1.__ to shut up and listen and let others own their stories; and __2.__ call out bad behavior by others with my privileges.

I’m sure I was a privileged asshole at some point in my career. In a meeting once I said “if we had the cajones to [do x]” and someone called me on it as (essentially) misogynistic. Others rolled their eyes and like a chump I apologized for what I said. I shouldn’t have apologized — I meant it when I said it, and what does an apology fix, anyway? But I should have called out the others who rolled their eyes.

I don’t want to Be an Ally. Being is easy. Doing is hard.
