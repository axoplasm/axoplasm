I believe
=========

My core principles
------------------
* Everyone is entitled to:
	* tell their own story
	* dignity
	* recognition
	* hope
* No one is entitled to anything else
* Everyone is responsible for:
	* themselves
	* everyone else
* I strive to:
	* carry my own water
	* tell the truth
	* stand so others may sit
	* leave every situation better than when I arrived (i.e. the “campsite” principle)
* The universe is:
	* fundamentally uncaring
	* incomprehensibly vast
	* random
	* without purpose
* All things and all people have intrinsic meaning and worth beyond their “usefulness” to anyone or anything else
	* Said meaning and worth are unknown, and unknowable
* There is no fundamental distinction between doing something (morally) good and doing something well. 
* “Evil” exists but is transient and contingent
    * Its major contingency arises when “good” people look away
    * …or choose expediency over quality
* “Good” exists only when we make it
* [Nostalgia is poison](https://axoplasm.com/blog/miss-this-dog-toilet/).

Religion/Sprituality
--------------------
* [Anything anyone says about God is wrong](https://axoplasm.com/blog/i-used-to-think-about-this-all-the-time/), *including this.*
* Don’t confuse the finger pointing at the moon with the moon.
* Souls arise gradually as a process of interacting with the world, and defining oneself in opposition to it.
* Personality and memory are erased at the moment of death; there will be no “afterlife” in which I perceive myself or my soul.
* But the soul may contain other components, perhaps collectively described as “spirit,” that is/are eternal and transferred between living beings and other energetic systems. 
	* This aspect of the soul has no relationship to Ego. We can perceive it in ourselves only to the degree we can dampen our Ego.
* Animals might have souls but humans might not be able comprehend them.
* Always the same river, never the same water.
* God “exists” in the same way money “exists.”
	* More accurately: of all the qualities of God (omnipotence, omnibenevolence, anthropomorphism, etc.) which we might want to discuss, “existence” is the least salient.
	* I *suspect* that there is a concrete disproof for any concrete description of God’s qualities. If we can accurately describe God as having a certain quality, that description can be disproven.
* I was never not an atheist like this. I never felt an absence of anything (a “God shaped hole”); it’s just that God is simply unnecessary to my understanding of the world. The (non)presence of God is irrelevant to me.
* I have a small collection of animistic beliefs that are actually __supersitions__:
	* Places retain a [psychic fingerprint](https://axoplasm.com/blog/the-original-stumptown-coffee/) of the activities that occur there
	* Similarly, powerful souls leave a psychic fingerprint on other souls
		* Simply being near good people can make you a better person
		* Simply being near [bad people](https://axoplasm.com/blog/gosh-its-having-no-soul-makes-everything-awful/) can make you a worse person
	* Tools have a “desire” to be used in certain ways. (Think of this as a soft refutation of “tools are morally neutral.”) The gun desires to kill. The bicycle desires to travel. The pot desires to feed people. 

Human Nature
------------
* People are essentially __good__ and fundamentally __lazy__
	* This explains about 99% of daily behavior.
	* Also assumes basic aspects of survival are assured. *Erst Fressen, dann Moral.*
* Some people intentionally harm others and recognize they are doing “evil.” 
    * I cannot comprehend their mentality and it may damage me spiritually to try
* But most evil is abetted by people who think they are doing “good”

Ethics, loosely
---------------
* The ends do not justify the means; indeed this statement and its more-common obverse are self-contradictory. There is no end, only means. The end you arrive at is entirely a process of your means.
* In English (and perhaps other languages), “right” and “wrong” have dual meanings: “right” may mean either “morally good” or “functionally appropriate.” These meanings are not fundamentally separable. In general, [good people strive to do things correctly](https://axoplasm.com/blog/right-and-wrong/).
* This is subtle, but failing to make distinctions has the effect of collectively damaging the ability to discern [reality from unreality](https://axoplasm.com/blog/reality-tv/). It is not coincidental that the worst people in the world also believe outrageous and unrealitistic things.

Health
------
* Human beings were [built](https://axoplasm.com/blog/ten-human-universals/) to:
    * Be outdoors all day long
    * [Walk long distances every day](https://axoplasm.com/blog/five-miles/)
    * Eat cooked food, mostly fibrous plant matter, but lots of other things
    * Spend most of their time in close proximity to people they know
* Failing to do the above is probably responsible for most of the physical, spiritual, and mental ailments of modern America
* Two hours of vigorous physical motion and fresh air, will fix many minor physical ailments, sniffles or aches or such, and most spiritual and mental ailments.
* Meat isn’t murder but it isn’t very polite. People who take excessive joy in eating meat are not mentally stable.
* [Bicycles are awesome](https://axoplasm.com/blog/a-perfect-machine/).

Interpersonal relationships
---------------------------
* Shake hands firmly and make eye contact.
* Avoid saying “sorry” and apologies generally. Apologies are about you, not the person wronged.
* Avoid saying “I promise.” Everything you say is an implicit promise.
* Avoid excuses. These are just another way of saying “I can’t keep my word, but I’m unwilling to own the consequences.”
* I don’t care who made this mess, everyone is obligated to clean it up together.
* Listen more than you talk.

Politics/Society
----------------
* I am a __conservative__ in the sense that my instinct is to save back for future generations those things that will be difficult or impossible to replace once they are used up.
* I am a __liberal__ in that society will evolve despite our conservative instincts, and we must ultimately embrace that evolution.

Environment
-----------
* Soil, water, clean air and trees. 
* I am not much moved by appeals to Fuzzy Seals and Huggable Owls. These species might be important as bellweathers of more catastrophic change, but my long term interest is in soil, water, clean air and trees.
* Humans, and in particular civilization, is ultimately dependent on a few fragile, complexly-interwoven systems. Our foremost concern should be preserving the smooth running of those systems.
* American have an unhealthy wilderness obsession. In all but a few places, humans have lived within the nonhuman (i.e. “natural”) world for thousands of years. The world will become a greener, better place when we stop trying to keep people “out of” nature, and instead treat the entire world like a garden: a thing to tend and attend to.
* Global warming and nuclear war are the preeminent existential threats to humanity and civilization.
* Future generations will judge the people of 2023 harshly for our attitudes about:
	* Factory farming
	* Resource depletion
	* Global warming
	* Our harm to biodiversity.
	* ... and that much of this was in service of such trivial pleasures
* They will judge us more harshly for these things than we judge past generations for their sins, because they will suffer every day the consequences of our recklessness. 
* And they will judge us for these things for many thousands of years.


Let’s check my privilege
------------------------
Upper-middle class, straight, white, cis, male, skinny, able-bodied other than poor eyesight, from a stable and loving family. Those are the [privileges](https://axoplasm.com/blog/so-many-privileges/) I was born with.

I never used to notice my privileges. In the past decade or so, I have begun to pay more attention to my identity; not coincidentally as I work and socialize with more people unlike myself. Only once, to my knowledge, has my identity ever been an issue, when I applied for a job at Planned Parenthood. They wanted a woman for the job and they told me so. It was No Big Deal. I guess I should’ve felt some injustice (“what if they told you __to your face__ that you wouldn’t get the job because you were a __woman__!”). I got a job at Kinko’s instead where I was oblivious to the fact that I could work the graveyard shift alone in the most dangerous part of town without fearing anything worse than a holdup. I never took precautions like locking the side door or leaving one phone on speed dial to 911. Like the woman who worked graveyard shift the other nights of the week. It never occurred to me that those were the kinds of things that other people had to do.

The beauty/tragedy of people with my privilege is that we just fail upward and then get mad at everyone else for not failing upward. (“How hard could it be? This is a __meritocracy__” etc.) 

I doubt my father, in the I dunno 1980s, often thought of himself as belonging to any culture other than Default. People with privilege can no longer obliviously take this for granted, and this is why we throw tantrums. Identity politics is work we never had to do before. 

The privilege I think most about is the upper-middle-class one. I used to believe that socioeconomic class matters more than other identities. But now I think that was my other privileges talking. 

Masculinity, in particular, is a dangerous privilege. Scratch a fascist and you will probably find a misogynist. Men have lost their way; “manhood” is not the state of “not being a woman,” it is the state of [“not being a boy.”](https://axoplasm.com/blog/youre-good-man/)

The privileges I think least about are sexual orientation and able-bodiedness. I have only begun to notice my (cis-)gender privileges, or to note it in others.

I don’t apologize for my privileges. I try not to apologize generally (see *Interpersonal Relationships,* above.) White liberal guilt is for the benefit of white liberals. My hop instead is __1.__ to shut up and listen and let others own their stories; and __2.__ call out bad behavior by others with my privileges.

I have been a privileged asshole at various points. In a meeting once I said “if we had the cajones to [do x]” and someone called me on it as (essentially) misogynistic. Others rolled their eyes and like a chump I apologized for what I said. I shouldn’t have apologized — I meant it when I said it, and what does an apology fix, anyway? But I should have [called out the others](https://axoplasm.com/blog/dude-not-cool/) who rolled their eyes: “hey, she’s right. That’s kinda sexist and I can do better.”

I don’t want to Be an Ally. Being is easy. Doing is hard.
