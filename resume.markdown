Selected work experience
------------------------

### 2017–Present: __Principal, Scrubjay__

[Scrubjay](//scrubjay.works) is a generalist digital workshop. We build digital experiences for socially-responsible organizations. Our current client roster includes [Mercy Corps](//mercycorps.org), [Fat Pencil Studio](//fatpencilstudio.com), [United Way of the Columbia-Willamette](//unitedway-pdx.org), [Preschool Marketplace](//preschoolmarketplace.org), [Early Learning Multnomah](//earlylearningmultnomah.org), and [Women for Women International](//womenforwomen.org).


### 2019–2022: __Design Lead and Engineering Manager, MicroMentor__

I led visual design and user experience design for [MicroMentor](//micromentor.org), a global platform in five languages connecting small business entrepreneurs with mentors around the world. I spearheaded and executed a 2019 redesign and redevelopment of the platform, dovetailing with an organizational strategy to own the product in-house from an external vendor. I devised and managed our project management and engineering practices. I worked closely with business owners, community members, and stakeholders to design an experience that served several diverse communities in five languages on six continents.


### 1999–2017: __Freelance web designer, UX designer, developer, and digital strategist__

Prior to forming Scrubjay in 2017, I maintained a successful freelance business, variously as either a side gig or main gig. I provided branding, web design, mobile app design, user experience design, and web development services to countless (hundreds of?) organizations. 


### 2013–2014: __Director of Design, OpenSourcery__

I led design efforts for a web development and software shop. Notable projects included leading full site redesigns for IQ Credit Union, United Way of the Columbia-Willamette, Portland State University College of the Arts, and Princeton (NJ) Public Library. I also worked with the accounts team to provide collateral and close sales conversations.


### 2007–2013: __Senior Designer, Mercy Corps__

I designed (and redesigned) multiple iterations of the main Mercy Corps web page, including two redesigns associated with major software migrations in 2009 and 2012. My primary work was with the online fundraising team, where we punched well above our weight. I also designed several websites for internal and external Mercy Corps projects, with varying degrees of integration with the Mercy Corps brand. I collaborated with the branding team to maintain brand consistency across multiple properties and in multiple media. In 2010, with the Digital Marketing Director, we pioneered the strategy for Personal Fundraising Pages, before this became a widespread industry practice. I conducted user research and led focus groups to optimize online fundraising strategies; the result was a highly-optimized donation experience, whose broad pattern has become an industry standard.


### 2005–2006: __Senior Usability Designer, ID Branding__

I designed and documented the user experience of the Intel Brand Center, a global extranet for distributing and managing on-brand creative


### 2002–2005: __Art Director, Curiosity Group__

I led a team of designers through the treacherous shoals of web, email, print, and interactive marketing. Not to mention pitching and wooing clients, guiding artistic direction, and keeping a firm hand on the tiller of User Experience. Clients included Hewlett-Packard, Paramount Television, and MacForce.


### 2000–2001: __Web Designer and Web Developer, CyberSight/NineDots__

I designed and developed websites for NW Natural, Dole Foods, Quaker Oats, and Cap’n Crunch. 


### 1999–2000: __Web Designer and Flash Animator, Headbone Interactive__

At my first-ever web design job after changing careers from Archaeology, I hand-rolled static page designs and game prototypes in HTML, wrote small CGI games, crafted Flash animations, and drew monkeys (and various other creatures) for kids‘ web portals. Clients included Headbone Zone, Discovery Channel, Fleet Bank, and CBS.


### 1992–1999: Archaeologist

I have a Master’s degree in anthropology and practiced archaeology for most of the 1990s throughout the western United States. I haven’t been in that world for a long time but I love to tell stories about it.
