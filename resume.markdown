Employment
----------

### Generalist, Axoplasm
_Portland OR    
1999 – now_

Strategy, visual design, UX design, Drupal, Django, and front-end development for a range of great nonprofit and small business clients.


### Design Director, OpenSourcery   
_Portland, OR   
2013 – 2014_

Strategy and design love for a crackerjack Drupal development shop.


### Senior Designer, Mercy Corps    
_Portland, OR       
2007 – 2013_   

Every day at Mercy Corps I was producing the best work of my life. I concepted, strategized, architected, mapped, and designed every public Mercy Corps website for six years, and did most of the front-end coding too. Our latest release is my Magnum Opus: a mobile-responsive, content-first Drupal 7 website with 30,000 nodes that raises $5+ million a year.


### Senior Web Architect, Ports 1961   
_Xiamen, China       
2007_

I oversaw web efforts for an international clothing company headquartered in China. Ports's brands include Ports 1961, Printemps China Department Stores, and Ports International (recently revealed to be the third most recognized brand in China). A team of Chinese web designers and developers worked under my direct supervision.


### Senior User Experience Designer, ID Branding   
_Portland, OR       
2005 – 2006_

I designed and documented the user experience of the Intel Brand Center, a global extranet for distributing and managing on-brand creative.


### Art Director, Curiosity Group   
_Portland, OR       
2002 – 2005_  

I led a team of designers through the treacherous shoals of web, email, print, and interactive marketing. Not to mention pitching and wooing clients, guiding artistic direction, and keeping a firm hand on the tiller of User Experience. Clients included Hewlett-Packard, Paramount Television, and MacForce.


### Designer/Developer, CyberSight/NineDots   
_Portland, OR       
2000 – 2001_

I designed (in the “drew pretty pictures” sense) and developed (in the “hand-tooled front-end code and Flash” sense) websites for NW Natural, Dole Foods, Quaker Oats, and Cap’n Crunch. Why are “designing” and “developing” always two separate jobs at creative agencies? That’s why my job title had a slash in it.


### Designer, Headbone Interactive   
_Seattle, WA       
1999 – 2000_

They paid me to draw monkeys. Not *just* monkeys, mind you, and of course the drawing was just a tiny part of my job (which also included a fair bit of front-end coding and Flash and CGI and whatnot) but yes, I did draw monkeys and *they paid me.*


### Staff Archaeologist, Statistical Research, Inc.

### Field Director/Staff Archaeologist, Ethnoscience
